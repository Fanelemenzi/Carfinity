# Inspection Workflow Demonstration

## Overview

The inspection workflow has been successfully implemented to allow technicians to fill out inspection forms first, then automatically calculate the vehicle health index based on their results.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Start New Inspection

**URL**: `/maintenance/inspections/start/`

Technician fills out basic information:
- Vehicle (VIN selection)
- Inspection year
- Inspection date

**Code Example** (from `StartInspectionWorkflowView`):
```python
def form_valid(self, form):
    # Generate unique inspection number
    form.instance.inspection_number = generate_inspection_number()
    
    # Set default values (will be updated by form)
    form.instance.inspection_result = 'FAI'  # Default to Failed
    form.instance.vehicle_health_index = 'Pending Assessment'
    
    # Save and redirect to form
    inspection = form.save()
    return redirect(f'/maintenance/inspection-forms/create/?inspection_id={inspection.id}')
```

### 2. Fill Out 50-Point Inspection Form

**URL**: `/maintenance/inspection-forms/create/?inspection_id=X`

Technician completes detailed checklist organized by categories:

#### Engine & Powertrain (10 points)
- Engine oil level & quality
- Oil filter condition
- Coolant level & leaks
- Drive belts for cracks/wear
- Hoses for leaks or soft spots
- Air filter condition
- Cabin air filter condition
- Transmission fluid level & leaks
- Engine/transmission mounts
- Fluid leaks under engine & gearbox

#### Brakes & Suspension (7 points)
- Brake pads/shoes thickness
- Brake discs/drums damage/warping
- Brake fluid level & condition
- Parking brake function
- Shocks/struts for leaks
- Suspension bushings & joints
- Wheel bearings for noise/play

#### Safety Equipment (5 points)
- Seat belts operation & condition
- Airbags (warning light off)
- Horn function
- First-aid kit contents
- Warning triangle/reflective vest present

*...and 28 more inspection points across all vehicle systems*

Each point can be marked as:
- **Pass** - Component is in good condition
- **Minor** - Minor issue that should be addressed
- **Major** - Major issue requiring attention
- **Fail** - Component has failed and needs immediate repair
- **N/A** - Not applicable to this vehicle

### 3. Automatic Health Index Calculation

When the form is marked as completed, the system automatically:

**Code Example** (from `Inspections.save()` method):
```python
def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
    # Set completion timestamp when form is marked as completed
    if self.is_completed and not self.completed_at:
        self.completed_at = timezone.now()
        
    super().save(*args, **kwargs)
    
    # Auto-update the related Inspection record with calculated health index
    if self.is_completed:
        self._update_inspection_record()

def _update_inspection_record(self):
    """Update the related Inspection record with calculated health index and result"""
    from .utils import calculate_vehicle_health_index
    
    health_index, inspection_result = calculate_vehicle_health_index(self)
    
    # Update the related Inspection record
    self.inspection.vehicle_health_index = health_index
    self.inspection.inspection_result = inspection_result
    self.inspection.save(update_fields=['vehicle_health_index', 'inspection_result'])
```

## Health Index Calculation Logic

The system uses a sophisticated weighted scoring algorithm:

### Weighting System

**Critical Systems** (High Weight 6-10 points):
```python
critical_systems = {
    'brake_pads': 10,      # Most critical
    'brake_discs': 10,     # Most critical
    'brake_fluid': 8,      # Very important
    'tire_tread_depth': 9, # Safety critical
    'tire_pressure': 7,    # Important for safety
    'headlights': 6,       # Visibility critical
    'brake_lights': 6,     # Safety signaling
    'seat_belts': 8,       # Passenger safety
    'steering_response': 9, # Control critical
}
```

**Important Systems** (Medium Weight 3-6 points):
```python
important_systems = {
    'engine_oil_level': 6,
    'coolant_level': 5,
    'battery_voltage': 5,
    'alternator_output': 4,
    'transmission_fluid': 5,
    'exhaust_system': 4,
    'air_filter': 3,
    'wiper_blades': 4,
}
```

**Minor Systems** (Low Weight 1-2 points):
```python
minor_systems = {
    'cabin_air_filter': 2,
    'interior_lights': 2,
    'infotainment_system': 1,
    'rear_view_camera': 2,
    'air_conditioning': 2,
    'power_windows': 1,
}
```

### Scoring Algorithm

For each inspected component:
- **Pass**: 100% of weight value
- **Minor Issue**: 70% of weight value
- **Major Issue**: 30% of weight value
- **Fail**: 0% of weight value
- **N/A**: Excluded from calculation

**Example Calculation**:
```python
# If brake_pads (weight=10) is marked as 'minor':
actual_score += 10 * 0.7  # = 7 points out of 10 possible
```

### Health Index Categories

Final percentage determines health category:
- **Excellent (90-100%)**: Vehicle in outstanding condition
- **Good (80-89%)**: Vehicle in good condition with minor maintenance needs
- **Fair (70-79%)**: Vehicle needs attention but is serviceable
- **Poor (60-69%)**: Vehicle has significant issues requiring maintenance
- **Critical (<60%)**: Vehicle has serious problems requiring immediate attention

### Inspection Result Determination

Based on health percentage and critical failures:

```python
def _determine_inspection_result(health_percentage, major_failures, minor_failures, critical_systems, inspection_form):
    # Check for critical system failures
    critical_failures = []
    for field_name in critical_systems.keys():
        field_value = getattr(inspection_form, field_name, None)
        if field_value in ['fail', 'major']:
            critical_failures.append(field_name)
    
    # Determine result
    if len(critical_failures) > 0:
        if len(critical_failures) >= 3 or health_percentage < 50:
            return "FAI"  # Failed
        elif any(getattr(inspection_form, field, None) == 'fail' for field in critical_failures):
            return "FJD"  # Failed due to major Defects
        else:
            return "FMD"  # Failed due to minor Defects
    
    # No critical failures - determine pass level
    if major_failures == 0 and minor_failures <= 2:
        return "PAS"  # Passed
    elif major_failures == 0 and minor_failures <= 5:
        return "PMD"  # Passed with minor Defects
    elif major_failures <= 2:
        return "PJD"  # Passed with major Defects
    else:
        return "FMD"  # Failed due to minor Defects
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Excellent Vehicle
**Input**: All critical systems pass, minor issues with cabin air filter
**Calculation**: 
- Critical systems: 100% score
- Minor systems: 70% score for cabin air filter
- **Result**: Health Index "Excellent (95%)", Inspection Result "PMD"

### Scenario 2: Critical Brake Failure
**Input**: Brake pads failed, brake discs major issue, everything else passes
**Calculation**:
- Brake pads: 0 points (failed)
- Brake discs: 3 points (30% of 10)
- Other systems: Full points
- **Result**: Health Index "Poor (65%)", Inspection Result "FJD"

### Scenario 3: Multiple Minor Issues
**Input**: 6 minor issues across various systems, no major failures
**Calculation**:
- All systems get 70% of their weight
- **Result**: Health Index "Good (85%)", Inspection Result "PMD"

## Automatic Recommendations

The system generates maintenance recommendations based on failed points:

```python
recommendation_map = {
    'brake_pads': "Replace brake pads immediately - critical safety issue",
    'brake_discs': "Inspect and potentially replace brake discs",
    'tire_tread_depth': "Replace tires - insufficient tread depth",
    'engine_oil_level': "Change engine oil and filter",
    'battery_voltage': "Test and potentially replace battery",
    # ... more mappings
}
```

**Example Output**:
- "URGENT: Replace brake pads immediately - critical safety issue"
- "Replace air filter"
- "Top up coolant and check for leaks"
- "Schedule comprehensive vehicle service due to multiple issues"

## Benefits of This Approach
