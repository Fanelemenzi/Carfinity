- **Major Issue**: 30% of weight value
- **Fail**: 0% of weight value
- **N/A**: Excluded from calculation

### Result Determination:
- **PAS (Passed)**: No major failures, â‰¤2 minor issues
- **PMD (Passed with Minor Defects)**: No major failures, â‰¤5 minor issues
- **PJD (Passed with Major Defects)**: â‰¤2 major failures
- **FMD/FJD/FAI (Failed)**: Multiple critical failures or health index <50%
