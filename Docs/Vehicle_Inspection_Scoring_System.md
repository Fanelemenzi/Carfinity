# Vehicle Inspection Scoring System

## Overview

The Vehicle Inspection Scoring System uses a sophisticated weighted algorithm to evaluate vehicle condition based on a comprehensive 50-point inspection checklist. This document explains how the health index is calculated and how pass/fail determinations are made.

## Scoring Methodology

### Weighted Point System

The system categorizes inspection points into three tiers based on safety criticality and impact on vehicle operation:

#### Critical Safety Systems (High Weight: 6-10 points)
These systems directly impact vehicle safety and receive the highest weights:

| System | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Brake pads | 10 | Critical for stopping power |
| Brake discs | 10 | Essential for braking effectiveness |
| Tire tread depth | 9 | Affects traction and stopping distance |
| Steering response | 9 | Critical for vehicle control |
| Brake fluid | 8 | Necessary for brake system function |
| Seat belts | 8 | Primary safety restraint system |
| Suspension bushings | 7 | Affects handling and stability |
| Tire pressure | 7 | Impacts handling and tire wear |
| Headlights | 6 | Essential for visibility |
| Brake lights | 6 | Critical for signaling other drivers |

#### Important Systems (Medium Weight: 3-6 points)
These systems affect vehicle reliability and performance:

| System | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Engine oil level | 6 | Engine protection and longevity |
| Coolant level | 5 | Prevents engine overheating |
| Battery voltage | 5 | Powers electrical systems |
| Transmission fluid | 5 | Transmission operation and protection |
| Alternator output | 4 | Charges battery and powers systems |
| Exhaust system | 4 | Emissions control and safety |
| Wiper blades | 4 | Visibility in adverse weather |
| Air filter | 3 | Engine performance and protection |
| Mirrors | 3 | Driver visibility and safety |

#### Minor Systems (Low Weight: 1-2 points)
These systems affect comfort and convenience:

| System | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Cabin air filter | 2 | Interior air quality |
| Interior lights | 2 | Convenience and visibility |
| Air conditioning | 2 | Driver comfort |
| Rear view camera | 2 | Parking assistance |
| Infotainment system | 1 | Entertainment and navigation |
| Power windows | 1 | Convenience feature |
| First aid kit | 1 | Emergency preparedness |
| Warning triangle | 1 | Roadside safety equipment |

### Condition Assessment Scale

Each inspection point is evaluated using a 5-point scale:

| Status | Score Multiplier | Description |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **Pass** | 100% | Component meets all requirements |
| **Minor Issue** | 70% | Small problem that doesn't affect safety |
| **Major Issue** | 30% | Significant problem requiring attention |
| **Fail** | 0% | Component completely fails inspection |
| **Not Applicable** | Excluded | Component not present on this vehicle |

### Health Index Calculation

The health index is calculated using this formula:

```
Health Index = (Actual Score / Total Possible Score) × 100%

Where:
- Actual Score = Σ(Weight × Condition Multiplier) for all inspected points
- Total Possible Score = Σ(Weight) for all inspected points
```

#### Example Calculation

**Vehicle with minor cabin air filter issue:**
- Cabin air filter: 2 points × 70% = 1.4 points
- All other systems pass: 98 points × 100% = 98 points
- **Total**: 99.4 out of 100 possible points = 99.4% (Excellent)

## Health Index Categories

The calculated percentage determines the overall health category:

| Category | Range | Description | Typical Action |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Excellent** | 90-100% | Vehicle in outstanding condition | Continue regular maintenance |
| **Good** | 80-89% | Vehicle in good condition with minor issues | Address minor issues soon |
| **Fair** | 70-79% | Vehicle needs attention | Schedule maintenance within 30 days |
| **Poor** | 60-69% | Vehicle has significant problems | Immediate maintenance required |
| **Critical** | <60% | Vehicle may be unsafe to operate | Do not drive until repaired |

## Pass/Fail Determination

The system uses six inspection result categories based on failure patterns and health scores:

### Pass Categories

#### PAS - Passed
- **Criteria**: 
  - No major failures in any system
  - Maximum 2 minor issues allowed
  - No critical system failures
- **Health Index**: Typically 85-100%
- **Action**: Continue normal operation and maintenance

#### PMD - Passed with Minor Defects
- **Criteria**:
  - No major failures in any system
  - 3-5 minor issues present
  - No critical system failures
- **Health Index**: Typically 75-90%
- **Action**: Address minor issues within 60 days

#### PJD - Passed with Major Defects
- **Criteria**:
  - Maximum 2 major failures
  - No critical system complete failures
  - Health index above minimum threshold
- **Health Index**: Typically 65-80%
- **Action**: Address major issues within 30 days

### Fail Categories

#### FMD - Failed due to Minor Defects
- **Criteria**:
  - More than 5 minor issues, OR
  - More than 2 major failures
  - No critical system complete failures
- **Health Index**: Typically 50-70%
- **Action**: Repair before next inspection

#### FJD - Failed due to Major Defects
- **Criteria**:
  - Critical system failures present
  - Any critical system marked as "fail"
  - Safety-related major issues
- **Health Index**: Typically 40-65%
- **Action**: Immediate repair required, vehicle may be unsafe

#### FAI - Failed
- **Criteria**:
  - 3 or more critical system failures, OR
  - Health percentage below 50%, OR
  - Severe safety-related failures
- **Health Index**: Typically <50%
- **Action**: Vehicle should not be operated until repaired

## Critical System Failure Logic

The system automatically triggers failure conditions when critical safety systems are compromised:

### Automatic Failure Triggers

1. **Brake System Failures**:
   - Brake pads completely worn
   - Brake discs severely damaged
   - No brake fluid or contaminated fluid

2. **Steering System Failures**:
   - Excessive steering play
   - Power steering failure
   - Steering components loose or damaged

3. **Tire Safety Failures**:
   - Tread depth below legal minimum (5/32")
   - Severely under-inflated tires
   - Tire damage affecting safety

4. **Lighting System Failures**:
   - Headlights not functioning
   - Brake lights not working
   - Turn signals inoperative

### Multiple Failure Assessment

When multiple systems fail, the severity escalates:

- **1 critical failure**: May still pass with restrictions (PJD)
- **2 critical failures**: Likely failure (FJD)
- **3+ critical failures**: Automatic failure (FAI)

## Scoring Examples

### Example 1: Well-Maintained Vehicle
```
Critical Systems: All Pass (70 points × 100% = 70 points)
Important Systems: All Pass (25 points × 100% = 25 points)
Minor Systems: All Pass (5 points × 100% = 5 points)

Total: 100/100 points = 100%
Result: Excellent Health Index, PAS (Passed)
```

### Example 2: Vehicle with Minor Issues
```
Critical Systems: All Pass (70 points × 100% = 70 points)
Important Systems: 2 Minor Issues (23 points × 100% + 2 points × 70% = 24.4 points)
Minor Systems: 1 Minor Issue (4 points × 100% + 1 point × 70% = 4.7 points)

Total: 99.1/100 points = 99.1%
Result: Excellent Health Index, PMD (Passed with minor Defects)
```

### Example 3: Vehicle with Critical Brake Issue
```
Critical Systems: Brake pads fail (60 points × 100% + 10 points × 0% = 60 points)
Important Systems: All Pass (25 points × 100% = 25 points)
Minor Systems: All Pass (5 points × 100% = 5 points)

Total: 90/100 points = 90%
Result: Excellent Health Index, but FJD (Failed due to major Defects)
Note: Critical brake failure overrides health percentage
```

### Example 4: Multiple System Failures
```
Critical Systems: 3 Major Issues (70 points × 70% = 49 points)
Important Systems: 2 Failures (23 points × 100% + 2 points × 0% = 23 points)
Minor Systems: All Pass (5 points × 100% = 5 points)

Total: 77/100 points = 77%
Result: Fair Health Index, FMD (Failed due to minor Defects)
```

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Rules

1. **Completion Requirements**: All critical systems must be inspected
2. **Technician Verification**: Qualified technician must complete inspection
3. **Documentation**: Notes required for all failed or major issue items
4. **Review Process**: Failed inspections require supervisor review

### Consistency Measures

- **Standardized Checklist**: All technicians use identical 50-point checklist
- **Clear Definitions**: Each inspection point has specific pass/fail criteria
- **Training Requirements**: Technicians must be certified on scoring system
- **Audit Process**: Random inspections reviewed for consistency

## Maintenance Recommendations

The system automatically generates maintenance recommendations based on inspection results:

### Priority Levels

1. **URGENT**: Critical safety systems that failed
2. **High Priority**: Major issues affecting safety or reliability
3. **Medium Priority**: Minor issues that should be addressed soon
4. **Low Priority**: Convenience items and preventive maintenance

### Sample Recommendations

- **Brake pads fail**: "URGENT: Replace brake pads immediately - critical safety issue"
- **Engine oil minor**: "Change engine oil and filter within 30 days"
