## System Architecture

The inspection system consists of two main components:

1. **Inspection Records** (`Inspection` model) - Basic inspection information
2. **Inspection Forms** (`Inspections` model) - Detailed 50-point checklist

### Data Flow

```
Vehicle → Inspection Record → Inspection Form (50-point checklist) → Results & Reports
```

## Models

### Inspection Model

Basic inspection record containing:
- Vehicle reference
- Inspection number (unique)
- Year
- Inspection result (Pass/Fail with variations)
- Carfinity rating
- Inspection date
- External links and PDF attachments

```python
class Inspection(models.Model):
    vehicle = models.ForeignKey(Vehicle, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    inspection_number = models.CharField(max_length=20, unique=True)
    year = models.IntegerField()
    inspection_result = models.CharField(max_length=30, choices=RESULT_CHOICES)
    carfinity_rating = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    inspection_date = models.DateField()
    # ... additional fields
```

## API Reference

### Model Properties

#### Inspections Model

```python
# Progress tracking
total_points_checked          # Number of completed points
completion_percentage         # Percentage complete (0-100)

# Issue detection
failed_points                 # List of failed inspection points
has_major_issues             # Boolean indicating major issues

# Status tracking
is_completed                 # Boolean completion status
completed_at                 # Timestamp of completion
```

### Form Methods

#### InspectionForm

```python
# Validation
clean()                      # Form-wide validation
clean_<field_name>()        # Field-specific validation

# Saving
save(commit=True)           # Save with completion tracking
```

## Database Schema

### Key Relationships

```sql
Vehicle (1) → (Many) Inspection
Inspection (1) → (1) Inspections
User (1) → (Many) Inspections (as technician)
```

### Indexes

Recommended indexes for performance:
- `inspection_date` (for date-based queries)
- `is_completed` (for filtering)
- `technician_id` (for technician-specific queries)
- `inspection__vehicle_id` (for vehicle-specific queries)

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization

1. **Select Related**: Use `select_related()` for foreign keys
2. **Prefetch Related**: Use `prefetch_related()` for reverse relationships
3. **Indexes**: Ensure proper indexing on frequently queried fields
4. **Pagination**: Implement pagination for large datasets

### Caching

Consider caching for:
- Inspection form templates
- Progress calculations
- Status summaries

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

1. **Authentication**: All views require login
2. **Authorization**: Technicians can only edit their own forms
3. **File Uploads**: PDF files are validated for type and size
4. **SQL Injection**: Use Django ORM to prevent SQL injection

### Data Validation

1. **Form Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
2. **File Validation**: Size and type checking for uploads
3. **Business Logic**: Validation of inspection completion rules

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Form Not Saving
- Check form validation errors
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Verify user permissions

#### Progress Not Updating
- Check that fields are being saved properly
- Verify `total_points_checked` calculation
- Ensure model `save()` method is called

#### Template Errors
- Verify custom template filters are loaded
- Check template inheritance
- Ensure static files are properly configured

#### File Upload Issues
- Check file size limits
- Verify file type validation
- Ensure proper media configuration

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check model integrity
python manage.py shell
>>> from maintenance_history.models import Inspections
>>> Inspections.objects.filter(is_completed=True).count()

# Validate forms
>>> from maintenance_history.forms import InspectionForm
>>> form = InspectionForm(data={})
>>> form.is_valid()
>>> form.errors

# Check template rendering
python manage.py collectstatic
python manage.py runserver --debug
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **PDF Report Generation**: Automatic PDF generation of completed inspections
2. **Email Notifications**: Notify supervisors of completed inspections
3. **Mobile App**: Native mobile app for field inspections
4. **Photo Attachments**: Allow photos for each inspection point
5. **Digital Signatures**: Electronic signatures for completed inspections
6. **Integration**: API integration with external inspection systems

### API Development

Consider developing REST API endpoints for:
- Mobile app integration
- Third-party system integration
- Automated reporting
- Data export/import
