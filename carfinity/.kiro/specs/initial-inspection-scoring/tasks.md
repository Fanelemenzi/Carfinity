# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Complete InitialInspection model structure and add scoring properties


  - Complete the truncated InitialInspection model with all 160 inspection points
  - Add calculated properties for scoring (total_points_checked, completion_percentage, failed_points, has_major_issues)
  - Add save method override to auto-calculate scoring when completed
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 2. Implement core utility functions for initial inspection scoring


  - Create calculate_initial_inspection_health_index function with 160-point weighting system
  - Implement determine_initial_inspection_result function with failure categorization logic
  - Add get_initial_inspection_field_weights function with categorized system weights
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [x] 3. Implement recommendation generation system


  - Create get_initial_inspection_recommendations function with specific maintenance recommendations
  - Add categorize_initial_inspection_failures function for failure analysis
  - Implement urgency marking for critical safety system failures
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Create comprehensive summary and reporting functions


  - Implement generate_initial_inspection_summary function with complete analytics
  - Add generate_initial_inspection_number function for unique inspection numbering
  - Create calculate_system_scores function for individual system scoring
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 5. Enhance admin interface with scoring displays and functionality


  - Update InitialInspectionAdmin with scoring-related list displays
  - Add completion percentage and health index displays to admin list view
  - Implement admin actions for bulk scoring operations and report generation
  - Add scoring information to admin fieldsets and readonly fields
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 6. Integrate scoring system with existing inspection workflow



  - Update model save methods to trigger scoring calculations automatically
  - Ensure scoring integrates seamlessly with existing admin interface patterns
  - Add error handling and validation for incomplete inspections
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
