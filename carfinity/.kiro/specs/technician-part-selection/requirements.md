# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the maintenance record creation form to allow technicians to select and track parts used during vehicle service. The current form allows basic maintenance record creation but lacks the ability to associate parts with service records, which is essential for inventory management, cost tracking, and comprehensive service documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a technician, I want to select parts used during vehicle maintenance, so that I can accurately track inventory usage and service costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a technician creates a maintenance record THEN the system SHALL display a parts selection interface
2. WHEN a technician searches for parts THEN the system SHALL filter available parts by name, part number, or category
3. WHEN a technician selects a part THEN the system SHALL allow them to specify the quantity used
4. WHEN a technician adds multiple parts THEN the system SHALL display all selected parts in a list format
5. WHEN a technician removes a part from the selection THEN the system SHALL update the parts list accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a technician, I want to see part details and availability, so that I can make informed decisions about part usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a technician views available parts THEN the system SHALL display part name, part number, current stock quantity, and unit cost
2. WHEN a technician selects a quantity THEN the system SHALL validate that the requested quantity does not exceed available stock
3. IF a part has insufficient stock THEN the system SHALL display a warning message and prevent selection of excess quantity
4. WHEN a technician views part details THEN the system SHALL show the estimated total cost for the selected quantity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a technician, I want to save maintenance records with associated parts, so that the service history includes complete part usage information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a technician submits a maintenance record with parts THEN the system SHALL create PartUsage records for each selected part
2. WHEN a maintenance record is saved THEN the system SHALL update part inventory quantities by subtracting used quantities
3. WHEN a maintenance record is saved THEN the system SHALL calculate and store the total service cost including parts
4. IF the form submission fails THEN the system SHALL preserve all selected parts and quantities for correction

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a technician, I want an intuitive interface for part selection, so that I can efficiently complete maintenance records without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a technician accesses the maintenance form THEN the system SHALL display the parts selection section clearly separated from other form fields
2. WHEN a technician interacts with the parts interface THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback for all actions
3. WHEN a technician adds parts THEN the system SHALL show a running total of estimated costs
4. WHEN a technician completes the form THEN the system SHALL validate that all required fields including parts are properly filled
5. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages for each issue

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want part usage to be properly tracked, so that inventory levels remain accurate and service costs are documented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a maintenance record with parts is created THEN the system SHALL automatically update inventory levels
2. WHEN part quantities reach low stock thresholds THEN the system SHALL flag these parts for reordering
3. WHEN maintenance records are viewed THEN the system SHALL display complete part usage history
4. WHEN inventory reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include part usage from maintenance records
